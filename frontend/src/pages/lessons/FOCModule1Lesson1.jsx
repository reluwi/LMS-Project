        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.
          These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information;
          extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
        </p>


        <br />
        <h2>Why It's Important</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more
          devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
        </p>


        <br />
        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)</li>
          <li>Types of Threats: Malware, Phishing, Ransomware</li>
          <li>Security Best Practices: Strong Passwords, Multi-Factor Authentication</li>
        </ul>


        <br />
        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
        <p>
          - In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack affected thousands of computers in over 150 countries.
          <br />
          - Data breaches in companies like Facebook and Yahoo exposed personal information of millions of users.
